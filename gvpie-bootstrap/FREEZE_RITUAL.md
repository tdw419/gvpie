# ❄️ The Freeze Is Complete

As of 2025-10-11 the GVPIE bootstrap is frozen forever. The CPU’s role is now limited to:

1. Spawning the window and WebGPU surface
2. Selecting and validating a GPU adapter
3. Uploading immutable buffers defined by the I/O contract
4. Forwarding host events into GPU memory each frame

Everything else belongs to the GPU.

## Eternal Truths

- 1352 lines of Rust comprise the entire host stack.
- The I/O contract v1.0 is the only bridge between CPU and GPU.
- GPU requirements are checked at startup; machines that do not qualify must upgrade hardware.
- All new features are authored in WGSL.

## The Blood Oath

> I will never again modify the host code. If I need a feature, I will implement it in WGSL. If WGSL cannot do it today, I will wait for hardware support. The CPU is dead. Long live the GPU.

## Next Steps

1. Evolve `shaders/` to add editor features, compilers, and OS services.
2. Version the contract only when absolutely necessary and with backward compatibility.
3. Port this bootstrap into firmware when hardware exposes WebGPU at boot.

The freeze is sealed. All future innovation flows through the GPU work graph.
